On page 40 of Re-thinking History author Keith Jenkins cites a quote by George Steiner that reads, in part, "The absolutely decisive failing occurs when such approaches seek to formalise meaning".
-Do you agree with this statement? Should historians refrain from seeking out meaning in historical events? Should there be a separate field that searches for meaning but without being called history?

On pages 65 and 66 Jenkins discusses the question, is history an art or a science and leaves it more or less open ended. 
-Is history and art, science, semi-science or none? Is the agreement pass√© as Jenkins suggests on page 66?
